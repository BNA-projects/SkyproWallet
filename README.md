💰 SkyproWallet

SkyproWallet is a team project developed as part of a multi-sprint collaboration. It’s a personal finance management app built with React, Context API, and Styled Components, featuring responsive design and an intuitive user experience.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of the project was to create a modern, functional web application that helps users manage their finances — from initial layout to full business logic integration and final polishing.

The work was divided into three sprints, following an agile development process similar to real-world product teams.

🏁 Development Process
Sprint 1 — Project Setup & Basic Layout
Goal: Build the project’s foundation and create a fully designed set of core pages.
Result:
Project structure initialized
Main pages fully designed and styled
Technical and visual base prepared for future development

Sprint 2 — API Integration & Business Logic
Goal: Implement core functionality and connect the app to the backend.
Result:
Data fetching and state management via Context API
Key user interaction flows implemented
API integrated for real user data and operations

Sprint 3 — Responsiveness & Final Polish
Goal: Deliver a complete, fully responsive, and production-ready application.
Result:
Adaptive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
UI/UX refinements and performance improvements
Toast notifications for user feedback
Final testing and preparation for presentation
